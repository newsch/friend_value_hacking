## Abstract

## Replication

We replicate Feld’s comparison of the distribution of friends and friends of friends with SNAP’s facebook dataset. In doing so we find that the distributions show similar behavior to Feld’s distributions of Marketville girl friend groups: the distribution of users’ friends shows that few users have many friends, while the distribution of friends of users’ friends is a weighted version of the original distribution weighted towards users with many friends.

The mean of the distribution of users’ friends is 43.7, while the mean of the distribution of users’ friends’ friends is 106.6. In this case, if individuals compared their number of friends with the mean number of friends of their own friends, and their friends were a representative sample of friends (with a mean number of friends of friends of 106.6), then 67.5% of individuals would find themselves to be “relatively deprived”. In Feld’s original study, he found that 74% of the individuals in Marketville would find themselves to be “relatively deprived”.

Feld explores the phenomenon of the friendship paradox, where most people on average tend to have fewer friends than their friends. He observes this through a network of high school friendships. He showed why the paradox exists, and how different network structure affects it.

Ugander et. al performed many different kinds of analyses on the facebook social graph, including degree distribution, degrees of separation, clustering and sparsity, site engagement, and directly addressing Feld’s friends of friends phenomenon. They conclude that the facebook social graph is highly connected, but with high clustering coefficient and high sparsity. It also shows that Feld’s friend of friends phenomenon is present in over 90% of facebook users.

Newman and Park discuss the structure of social networks and how they differ from other networks. They observe high clustering levels and hypothesize that this is the result of communities in social networks. They propose a model of community structure to explain the clustering.
