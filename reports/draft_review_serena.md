## Epidemic Spread through Trade Routes in Medieval Europe and Asia

This is a pretty interesting question, and I think you have a good extension! Quarantining hub cities is really interesting. However, I wish I better understood what a hub city means, though. You have the definition, which is a node of degree 7 or more, but where does that number come from? Can you show some examples of hub cities, or have a distribution of degrees to show the degree 7 cut off? Or something in the original paper. Other than that, the problem definition is pretty clear, and I think your model makes sense, at least at the high level the report is at.

I'm assuming the replication is in the part where you can quarantine any city. Maybe include a bit where you show it is consistent with the original paper. You have very thorough results (much appreciated), but it can be a little hard to read. One thing you can do is turn the three graphs for {0.15, 0.25, 0.5} transmission rates into 2 graphs, one for *total infections* and the other for *number of infected cities*, and use different colors for the different transmissions rates. It's easier to compare the lines when they have the same y scale. Similarly, it would help if the color scales on the two purple graphs were the same.

Your interpretation of the results was good. I like how everything was really grouded in the numbers, and your explanation for some of the unexpected behavior. However, this excerpt in particular:

> The number of cities not infected with per city quarantined is 7.6 on average when only hub cities are quarantined and 2.3 when any city can be quarantined. When the number of cities not infected excludes the quarantined cities the average cities not infected drops to 6.9 when only hub cities are quarantined and 1.5 when any city can be quarantined.

was a little difficult to read since there were so many descriptors. Maybe a short table would be better. Also average doesn't feel like the right statistical measure to represent a series of data derived with different parameters; maybe a range would be better.

Overall, the report is really well written. You are in a good place in this project, and it feels like y'all know what you need to do. Keep up the good work :)
