## Assigned Questions

### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The replicated experiment deals with Black Plague infection models of European and Asian cities and explores the relationship of reinfection with hub cities. The explanation seems plenty clear.

### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology comes across pretty clearly and makes sense for the question.

I'd be curious to see the relationship between degree of connectivity and population.

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The results of the original report aren't presented graphically, but the figures that ae in the report are all labeled.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The analysis of the initial report isn't clear.

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the 

The paper does not seem to have results from the replication, but does seem to affirm them.

### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

It does explain a clear and interesting extension to the original experiment, exploring the effect of quarantines in hub cities on infection rates.

### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I'm unclear about the replication, but the extension seems to be well-defined and nearly complete.

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

It seems pretty consistent and clear, other than the replication.

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yup, yup, yup, and yup!

## General Notes

- Overall I think it looks pretty great, I think it just needs a clearer separation of repication and extension.
- I'm curious why you settled on >6 for hub cities - is that informed by the original paper, your own analysis, or something else?
